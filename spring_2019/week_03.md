## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I was able to work on reading up on fingerprint authentication documentation. I was also able to begin working on a Settings UI that I will probably push by the end of today.
- Karthik and I decided that we'll be working on two different aspects of the TouchID feature. I will be working on backwards compatibility for users that either don't have fingerprintID enabled or users that have software versions.

## This Week's Plan

- This coming week I will contnue to read up on documentation for the fingerprint authentication (backward compatibility)
- I will also work on the settings page UI.
- I will also possibly work on the UI for the fingerprint authentication screen, since the API that I'm using does not provide its own authentication scre

## Anything Blocking?

- faceID will not be implemented this semester (more of AI component  for Android platform)
