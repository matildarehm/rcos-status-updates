## Last Week's Accomplishments

- This past week, I was able to work on reading up on fingerprint authentication documentation. I was also able to begin working on a Settings UI that I will probably push by the end of today.
- Karthik and I decided that we'll be working on two different aspects of the TouchID feature. I will be working on backwards compatibility for users that either don't have fingerprintID enabled or users that have software versions.
- I've also worked on simulating a fingerprint with the Terminal. This has been an issue for me, a took a bit longer than I expected to learn.
- Completed Settings UI

## This Week's Plan

- This coming week I will contnue to read up on documentation for the fingerprint authentication (backward compatibility)
- I will work on implementing working preferences for settings UI panels
- Continue working of fingerprint simulation
- Begin implementing email for fixx in Settings panel
- I will also possibly work on the UI for the fingerprint authentication screen, since the API that I'm using does not provide its own authentication screen (I didn't get around to doing this the last time)

## Anything Blocking?

- faceID will not be implemented this semester (more of AI component  for Android platform)
