## Last Week's Accomplishments

- While I've completed the Settings UI, I've been having trouble creating the actual preferences layout. I found out that there needs to be a separate file in an xml directory (from Stack Overflow)

## This Week's Plan

- Making finishing touches on settings UI
- Get preferences layout to work
- Connect with default email application
- Fix modal for fixx and feedback as well
- More front end

## Anything Blocking?
