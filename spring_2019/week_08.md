## Last Week's Accomplishments

- I've been osrt of blocked on the finger print authentication and fingerprint simulation for phones without built-in finger print functionality. It appaears to be a bit more difficult than BIOMETRICS
- I have also been working on the Preferences screen. Most of my work is in a branch right now

## This Week's Plan

- As Karthik and I have been working in spearate branches as to minimize merge conflicts and possible screw ups with separate code we've been working on, it appears that our code works separately.
- In preparation for the demos and presentations, the plan is to start push all functional elements of the app to the master branch

## Anything Blocking?

- Fingerprint simulation. I've been watching a couple of helpful Youtube Videos that have provided the necessary insight
